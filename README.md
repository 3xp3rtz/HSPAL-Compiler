From https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_Stacking_Pseudo-Assembly_Language: 
"The Hexadecimal Stacking Pseudo-Assembly Language (HSPAL) is a programming language...in which a program is represented by a list of six-digit [hexadecimal] numbers separated by line breaks".
By taking a look at the documentation of the language (found here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkG501LjlcrESdrlddE5qEb157w9W0_BeS-zngQJEP4/edit), we can write our own compiler to run HSPAL instructions.

The manner in which I did so was (unnecessarily inefficient but nonetheless) by maintaining a dictionary of arrays indexed hexadecimally to represent stacks, pushing and popping using *append()* and *pop()*, respectively. By running the compiler with print statements denoting the command bring run, we can see that the first segment of code can be shown as:
```
0 200027 - r = 0027
1 400100 - push register to stack[01], register = 0
2 001234 - make label 1234
3 10ff00 - push one char to stack ff
4 410100 - register = pop stack[01]
5 400200 - push register to stack[02], register = 0
6 200001 - r = 0001
7 400100 - push register to stack[01], register = 0
8 410200 - register = pop stack[02]
9 400100 - push register to stack[01], register = 0
10 220100 - push sub stack[01], stack[01] to stack[01]
11 420100 - register = last elem of stack[01]
12 400100 - push register to stack[01], register = 0
13 200000 - r = 0000
14 400100 - push register to stack[01], register = 0
15 300100 - push equals (stack[01] == stack[01]) to stack[00]
16 030000 - skip if (pop stack 00)
17 011234 - go to 1234
3 10ff00 - push one char to stack ff
4 410100 - register = pop stack[01]
5 400200 - push register to stack[02], register = 0
...
```
The program loops after reaching instruction #17, which jumps back to instruction #3 if #16 results in not skipping the following command. Reading the code more closely, #15 pushes a value to stack[00] which is non-zero if the top two elements on stack[01] are the same. #13 and #14 pushes an element of `0` onto stack[01], #11-12 duplicate the top element of stack[01], #8-10 subtracts the the top element of stack[01] from stack[02], pushing the result back onto stack[01], #6-7 pushes `1` onto stack[01], #4-5 moves the top element of stack[01] to stack[02], and finally #3 simply adds a character from input to stack[ff]. Not within the loop is #0-1 which adds `27` to the top of stack[01] and #2 which labels an instruction.
Reordering these and simplifying it leaves us with:
```
0-1   Add 27 to stack[01]
2     Mark loop
3     Add input char to stack[ff]
4-5   Move top of stack[01] into stack[02]
6-7   Push 1 onto stack[01]
8-10  Subtract stack[01] from stack[02]
11-12 Duplicate top of stack[01]
13-14 Add 0 to stack[01]
15    Check if top two elements on stack[01] are equal, push result to stack[01]
16    Loop if stack[01] is non-zero
```
Simplifying further and running through the first loop with the we can attain
```
0-1   Add 27 to stack[01]
Loop: 
3     Get input
4-5   Move 27 to stack[02]
6-10  Subtract 1 from stack[02], move result to stack[01]
11-12 Duplicate stack[01]
13-15 Check if top element of stack[01] is equal to 0
16    If not, jump back to beginning of loop
```
This seems very much like a for loop, once we simplify one final time. (I've removed unrelated commands for readability.)
```
0-1   Add 27 to stack[01]   Iterator
Loop:
4-5   Move iterator to stack[02]
6-10  Subtract 1 from iterator
13-16 If iterator == 0, jump to beginning of loop
```
